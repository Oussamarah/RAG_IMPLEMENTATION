# RAG_IMPLEMENTATION
This project covers the RAG implementation pipeline while describing/including almost all available implementation methods for each component of the pipeline.

The RAG pipepline can be broken to three main phases, indexing, retrieval and generation. Each of these can be implemented through several methods. The reader should keep in mind that a lot of these techniques are leveraging ways of numerical representations of Data as we will discuss in upcoming sections.
